## Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end data analytics project** focused on understanding **customer shopping behavior**. It covers the complete analytics workflow — from **data cleaning and preprocessing using Python**, to **data analysis using SQL**, and finally **interactive visualization using Power BI**.

The project demonstrates how raw customer data can be transformed into meaningful business insights that support data-driven decision-making.

---

 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw customer shopping data
- Analyze purchasing patterns and customer behavior
- Identify top-selling products and categories
- Build an interactive dashboard for business insights

---

 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and validation  
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data analysis, aggregation, and ranking  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and visualizations  
- **CTEs & Window Functions** – Advanced SQL analysis  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project deployment

 Data Cleaning (Python Notebook)
Before analysis, the raw dataset was cleaned using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**, which included:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Renaming and standardizing columns
- Data type corrections
- Removing duplicates
- Preparing clean data for SQL analysis

This step ensured higher data quality and more reliable insights.

---

 SQL Analysis Performed
- Category-wise purchase analysis  
- Item-level purchase frequency  
- Ranking top items per category using window functions  
- Aggregations using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  
- Business-focused querying for dashboard use  

---

Power BI Dashboard Highlights
- Interactive **dropdown slicers**
- Category and product-level insights
- Clean, easy-to-understand visuals
- Business-ready dashboard for stakeholders

The dashboard allows users to explore customer behavior dynamically and identify trends quickly.
